  <p style="color: green">MOBILE RESPONSIVE</p>

- This assignment was very tricky and took me a while to figure out how to place the elements. I used `flex-direction` and set them to `column-reverse` to achieve mobile responsiveness. I also used `z-index` to achieve the discount section

## Learnings
